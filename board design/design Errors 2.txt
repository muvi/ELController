- Micorphone footprint wrong
- neu bom erzeugen, C135 nicht mehr NU
- GPIO Text inside connector
- NU parts in output_enable circuit entfernen
- Remove zero ohm in output channels
- footprint outline for Display shifted slightly on silkscreen (and courtyard?)
- swap LED against a more heat stable one
- more Testpoints for output channel H bridge (at least one directly before each gate)
- distancxes for fill in output channels to low (solved?)
- silkscreen for display right shifted slightly

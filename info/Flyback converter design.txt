- t_2 = (t_1 * V_in) / ((V_out + V_d) * (N_p/N_s))
  -> t_2: reverse conduction time
  -> t_1: on time / forward conduction time
  -> V_in: Input voltage
  -> V_out: current output voltage in capacitor
  -> V_d: Diode voltage drop
  -> N_p: Primary turns
  -> N_s: Secondary turns
  
t_1 = 2us
V_in = 12V
V_out = 0V
N_p/N_s = 0.1
